rhinoUnfolder
==============
A Python plugin to Rhino that unfolds meshes.

You can use it to create flat, foldable versions of your 3D models. It's like [Pepakura](http://www.tamasoft.co.jp/pepakura-en/) for Rhino.

Status
------
I am currently doing a major refactoring of this project, to support unfolding of mesh into multiple islands, and to make code more modular and readable.
High level functionality is disabled at the moment.
I am also currently creating tests for all modules. to test,
do -RunPythonScript, reset engine, and then execute run_all_tests.py


How To Run
----------

1. [Install Rhino and RhinoPython](http://python.rhino3d.com/content/118-Getting-Started-1-quot-Hello-Rhino-quot)
2. Download this repository and save it to your Rhino 'Scripts' directory:
  `git clone https://github.com/jlopezbi/rhinoUnwrapper.git`
3. *** NEEDS TO BE UPDATED ***
