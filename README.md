A Python plugin to Rhino that unfolds meshes.

You can use it to create flat, foldable versions of your 3D models. It's like [Pepakura](http://www.tamasoft.co.jp/pepakura-en/) for Rhino.

rhinoUnfolder is alpha softwareâ€”it isn't finished yet. Don't expect it to work for you.

**Basic mesh unwrapping is working**!

Also, it can only unwrap relatively simple meshes with few areas of high curvature. It uses a face-angle weight function. Try adding new weight functions for higher quality unfoldings.
